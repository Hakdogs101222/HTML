            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is <strong>Vince Ardee H. Gallardo</strong>, a student driven by curiosity 
                and a love for <b>Science</b> and <b>Coding/ICT</b>.  
                I enjoy expanding my knowledge through learning <i>Japanese</i>, exploring 
                <i>abstract coding problems</i>, and refining my <em>study habits</em> consistently.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am fascinated by the intersection of logic and creativity, whether it’s solving challenging 
                programming problems, strategizing in <strong>chess</strong>, or experimenting with 
                scientific concepts.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hobbies & Personal Growth</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond academics, I love immersing myself in mentally stimulating activities.  
                I regularly play <strong>chess</strong> to sharpen my strategic thinking, and I enjoy experimenting 
                with new coding projects to apply theoretical knowledge practically.  
                I usually wake up around <u>4 AM</u> to maintain discipline and maximize productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                A principle I live by is <mark>consistency</mark>. I believe that progress is achieved through 
                small, deliberate steps taken regularly, whether it’s mastering a new language, improving 
                in chess, or refining my coding skills.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Fun Details & Philosophies</h2>
            <p>
                Life is full of unexpected moments — for instance, I was chased by the same stray dog three 
                times in a single week this year! Such experiences remind me to stay alert, resilient, and 
                adaptable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I find inspiration in meaningful quotes. For example, <blockquote><strong>"Carpe diem"</strong></blockquote> — 
                <em>“Seize the day”</em> — encourages me to live fully and embrace opportunities without hesitation.  
                At the same time, <blockquote><strong>"Memento mori"</strong></blockquote> — <em>“Remember that you will die”</em> — 
                keeps me grounded and reminds me to prioritize what truly matters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together, these quotes guide me to balance ambition with mindfulness, making each day both productive 
                and meaningful.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
            <blockquote>
                “Medicine, law, business, engineering, <b>these are all noble pursuits, and
                necessary to sustain life.</b> But poetry, beauty, romance, love, <b>these are what we stay alive for.</b>”
                <small style="text-align: right; margin:0;">-Dead Poets Society</small>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
            <p>
                In coding, I often test concepts with:  
                <code>console.log("Hello, World!");</code>  
                A useful keyboard shortcut I rely on is  
                <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> for copy and pastes.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                I am particularly drawn to complex concepts and intricate problems, such as advanced <strong>statistics</strong> 
                and scientific formulas. I enjoy analyzing chemical notations like H<sub>2</sub>O, exploring mathematical 
                patterns, and working with powers such as 4<sup>th</sup> exponents. Tackling these challenging topics 
                strengthens my analytical thinking and allows me to approach problems with precision and creativity.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond coding and statistics, I have also taken a keen interest in <strong>poetry, literature, and grammar</strong>.  
                As reflected in my favorite quote, these pursuits remind us of what truly makes life meaningful.  
                In a world where many academic endeavors revolve around practicality and survival, I stay grounded,  
                taking the time to explore and appreciate the beauty of life that lies beneath the structured ideologies  
                of humanity as slaves of capitalism and money.
            </p>
